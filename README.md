📰 News Summarization & Recommendation System
An intelligent web-based NLP application that generates concise summaries of long-form news articles and recommends similar news headlines. Built with cutting-edge Transformer models from Hugging Face and deployed via Gradio for an intuitive user experience.

🚀 Features
✅ Summarization of News Articles
✅ Transformer-based NLP (BART-large-cnn)
✅ Real-time Text Generation
✅ Clean, Minimal Web Interface (Gradio)
✅ Easy Deployment (Local or Hugging Face Spaces)
✅ Extensible for Future Enhancements

🎯 How It Works
Model Used:
facebook/bart-large-cnn – a pre-trained Transformer model fine-tuned specifically for summarization tasks.

Architecture:
Encoder-Decoder sequence-to-sequence model based on BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers). The encoder compresses the input, while the decoder generates coherent summaries.

Pipeline:

Input long news article

Model processes and compresses information

Returns short, human-readable summaries

Tech Stack:

Python

Transformers (Hugging Face)

Gradio

PyTorch backend
